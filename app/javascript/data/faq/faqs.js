    question: "How does Falcon's pricing work?",
    answer:
      "The free version of Falcon is available for teams of up to 15 people. Our Falcon Premium plans of 15 or fewer qualify for a small team discount. As your team grows to 20 users or more and gets more value out of Falcon, you'll get closer to our standard monthly price per seat. The price of a paid Falcon plan is tiered, starting in groups of 5 and 10 users, based on the number of people you have in your Team or Organization."
